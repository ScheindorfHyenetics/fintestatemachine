# finitestatemachine
a finite state automaton designer and playable

Implemented in javascript.
Still in heavy development.

I don't know if I'll finish it
I went the wrong way, programming with a bad pattern

Can :
* create states
* drag and drop states
* remove state (press shift while clicking on one)
* add transitions (double click a state, then click the second, and input the transition key)
* display link between objects (It's bad, we dont know which one is the parent, but I find it hard to draw arrow)

Cannot :
* rename states
* see transition from a state to himself
* see the hierarchy in links
* see transition symbol a link is accepting
* place initial state
* define accepting states
* emulate the finite state machine
